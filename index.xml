But the most important one of all is “where the rubber meets the road”. Tires may be the most important component on your bike. The right tire at the right pressure makes a huge difference to your safety - your “grip” on the road - as well as to your comfort, and efficiency.
Diving into detail on tires, with a focus on tire width, tire pressure, and tire quality, we will discover:</description></item><item><title>How to Crash</title><link>/pages/cyclingsafety/how_to_crash/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/cyclingsafety/how_to_crash/</guid><description>You will crash - learn to crash properly I’m in the middle of a tight pack of two dozen racers at the Pan-Am Games velodrome, 5 laps from the end of the race, averaging 45kph. There’s a sudden slowing as riders position themselves for the finishing sprint. I hear swearing, and the unmistakable sound of carbon wheels scraping each other as multiple riders make contact at speed. A rider just above me goes down and slides across my rear wheel.</description></item><item><title>How not to Fall (at low speed)</title><link>/pages/cyclingsafety/how_not_to_fall/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/cyclingsafety/how_not_to_fall/</guid><description>In the previous article, we mentioned that many serious cycling injuries happen when cyclists are slowing and preparing to stop. So let’s discuss some techniques to prevent low speed falls.
Now all this may seem like a lot of effort. But it’s much preferable to broken bones! (As the old aged goes… you can say me now or pay me later!)

As a cyclist, the risk of injury requiring hospital treatment (per km travelled) is significantly greater than when in a motor vehicle. The more you cycle, the greater the risk - You will crash!</description></item><item><title>After You Crash &amp; Your Helmet Saves Your Head!</title><link>/pages/cyclingsafety/after_you_crash/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/cyclingsafety/after_you_crash/</guid><description>BANG! Hisss…! A Puncture! But who? Where? I’m riding in a peloton of 24 tightly packed riders in the middle of the steep banking on the Pan-Am Games Velodrome in Milton Ontario. It’s impossible to stay up on the banking after a puncture. Everyone knows someone is going down, and is going to take other riders with them. I’m a loser of this lottery. The rider with the puncture slides down in front of me and I flip over their bike at 34KPH, as four of us go down.</description></item><item><title>Sizes of Our Local Velodromes</title><link>/pages/tracknut/velodrome_sizes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/tracknut/velodrome_sizes/</guid><description>Sizes of our local velodromes Velodrome Length Bank Angle Track Width Straight Angle Length at Rail Radius Milton 250 42 7 12 285 UCI Cat 1 250 42-45 ?? 7-8 12-13 285 ?? 19-25 FCV 138 51 4.8 17 ?? https://plus.maths.org/content/leaning-2012 - great article of physics of velodrome bankings

Or sweat it out indoors on a trainer, listening to music or a video to combat the boredom?
There’s another option! With the construction of the Mattamy National Cycling Centre for the Pan Am Games, there’s a beautiful world-class indoor velodrome facility within reasonable driving distance of Ottawa. I expect many people associate “velodrome” with competitive cycling - that it’s just for the racers, cyclo-sportifs, the “really fast guys”.</description></item><item><title>Velodrome Basics</title><link>/pages/tracknut/about_velodromes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/tracknut/about_velodromes/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page gives you a detailed tour around velodromes, using the two indoor velodromes in Ontario as examples:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ontario Track Cycling Resources</title><link>/pages/tracknut/ontario_track_resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/tracknut/ontario_track_resources/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page contains links to velodromes and organizations of interest to riders in Ontario&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Essential Rules of the Track</title><link>/pages/tracknut/basic_rules/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/tracknut/basic_rules/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page is deliberately short.

We&amp;rsquo;re a couple of, well old, guys from Ontario that have re-discovered the joy of track cycling after over 30 years absence from the track. With the construction of the amazing Mattamy National Cycling Centre in 2015, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the lure of a UCI class 1 velodrome on our doorstep. We&amp;rsquo;re generally on the track multiple times a week.</description></item><item><title>About Bill Bourne</title><link>/about/aboutbillbourne/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/aboutbillbourne/</guid><description>I started programming in 1972 (Fortran, APL, assembler) Even though my university degree was in Electrical Engineering, my whole professional career has been software related.

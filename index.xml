This site is written in &lt;a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown&lt;/a> and generated with the static site generator (SSG) &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a>. Markdown is a simple plain text document format that can be easily and quickly processed to generate html, pdf, .docx, and a number of other file formats. I use it for just about all my writing - for documents and articles (I avoid Microsoft Word at all costs!), note taking, and for writing web pages. Hugo quickly generates an efficient website. Since the website is made up only of static webpages and a little JavaScript, it renders fast.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Joy of Recreational Track Cycling</title><link>/tracknut/joy_of_track/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracknut/joy_of_track/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the depths of winter, options for cycling become less appealing… Do I ride outdoors in the cold, wet, and wind?

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sealant must be replaced every few months, at least once a season.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sealant does not always seal a hole, especially if the hole is larger than a few mm.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need to carry either a spare tube (and a tool to remove the tubeless value) or tire plugs and a small tube of sealant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Having sealant spewing out can get really messy!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can&amp;rsquo;t go about 75psi with tubeless tires, so tubeless and skinny tires don&amp;rsquo;t work together. Jay Heins of Hene Herse, who makes some of the world&amp;rsquo;s best tubeless tires says don&amp;rsquo;t go about 6-psi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Valve core clogs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tubeless tires are much more diufficult to install and remove. It can be difficult to get the bead to seal on the rim - often rapid inflation with a special &amp;ldquo;charger pump&amp;rdquo; or an air compressor is required.&lt;/li>

He challenges the assumption about our behavior that permeates western, and particularly American, culture: &amp;ldquo;the norm of self-interest&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Alexis de Tocqueville, that sharp observer of the American psyche during the formative years of the United States, noticed the norm even then: “Americans,” he wrote in 1835, “enjoy explaining almost every act of their lives on the principle of self-interest.” He thought that in doing this they were underplaying their own benevolence, because in his view Americans were, just like everyone else, moved by spontaneous natural impulses to help others. But in contrast to Europeans, Americans, he found, were “hardly prepared to admit that they do give way to emotions of this sort.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Timeless Rules of Software Development</title><link>/hidden/timeless-software-dev/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hidden/timeless-software-dev/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="rules">Rules&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>“&lt;strong>Given the amount of time I spend on a bike, I recognize there is a significant probability that my cycling career, or even my life, could end as a result of a serious cycling accident&lt;/strong>”.
As a cyclist, the risk of injury requiring hospital treatment (per km travelled) is significantly greater than when in a motor vehicle.

&lt;h2 id="many-flavours-of-markdown">Many Flavours of Markdown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many variants of Markdown formats, and each processor may support a range of extensions, and interpret the Markdown specifications in somwhat different ways. The main formats include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="(http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)">Markdown&lt;/a> - this is the classic orginal version&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://fletcher.github.com/peg-multimarkdown/mmd-manual.pdf">Multimarkdown&lt;/a> - the orginal extension to Markdown&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/">GitHub Flavored Markdown&lt;/a> -a small set of extension to Markdown defined by GitHub&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/syntax.html">Kramdown&lt;/a> - extensive set of extensions based on &lt;a href="http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/">PHP markdown Extra package&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://maruku.rubyforge.org">Maruku&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown">Pandoc&lt;/a> - extensive set of extensions, but strays from the original markdown syntax and extensions somewhat&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sealant must be replaced every few months, at least once a season.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sealant does not always seal a hole, especially if the hole is larger than a few mm.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need to carry either a spare tube (and a tool to remove the tubeless value) or tire plugs and a small tube of sealant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Having sealant spewing out can get really messy!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can&amp;rsquo;t go about 75psi with tubeless tires, so tubeless and skinny tires don&amp;rsquo;t work together. Jay Heins of Hene Herse, who makes some of the world&amp;rsquo;s best tubeless tires says don&amp;rsquo;t go about 6-psi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Valve core clogs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tubeless tires are much more diufficult to install and remove. It can be difficult to get the bead to seal on the rim - often rapid inflation with a special &amp;ldquo;charger pump&amp;rdquo; or an air compressor is required.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Tires may be the most important component on your bike. The right tire at the right pressure makes a huge difference to your safety - your “grip” on the road - as well as to your comfort, and efficiency.

&lt;p>“&lt;strong>Given the amount of time I spend on a bike, I recognize there is a significant probability that my cycling career, or even my life, could end as a result of a serious cycling accident&lt;/strong>”.
As a cyclist, the risk of injury requiring hospital treatment (per km travelled) is significantly greater than when in a motor vehicle. The more you cycle, the greater the risk - &lt;strong>You will crash!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>After You Crash &amp; Your Helmet Saves Your Head!</title><link>/cyclingsafety/after_you_crash/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cyclingsafety/after_you_crash/</guid><description>After a crash, the adrenaline will be pumping… an injured rider will not necessarily feel pain, and often will say “I’m OK” and want to get back on their bike.

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>What kind of G-forces do riders experience when riding though bankings at speed?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A low speeds a rider &amp;ldquo;leans out&amp;rdquo; in the banking as gravity pushes them down the track. A high speeds a rider leans in as the centrifugal force tends to push them up the track. There is a speed when a rider transitions between these two states, a speed when the bike is exactly orthogonal to (i.e. perpendicular to, or at 90 degrees to) the surface of the track. What is this speed?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the minimum speed you need to ride to avoid &amp;ldquo;falling off&amp;rdquo; in a banking?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The material that follows is based on two excellent posts on the subject:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

# Coaching

I find it's true that the best way to learn something well is to teach it to someone else. The act of teaching forces me to reflect deeply on what I think I know. This is especially true of coaching. By approaching coaching with humility and a passion for the subject, I'm always learning and growing yourself.

I'm passionate about track, and have introduced over a hundred people from age 9 to senior citizens to the fun of riding steeply banked velodromes.

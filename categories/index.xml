&lt;p>Back in 2015, I re-discovered the joy of track cycling after 30 years absence from the track. With the construction of the &lt;a href="http://www.mattamynationalcyclingcentre.ca/en/index.asp">Mattamy National Cycling Centre&lt;/a> in Milton for the Pan-Am games, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the lure of an international class velodrome within driving distance.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

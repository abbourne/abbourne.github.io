Or sweat it out indoors on a trainer, listening to music or a video to combat boredom?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There’s another option - Indoor velodromes! Living in Ottawa, there are now three excellent velodromes I can frequent:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Velodrome Basics</title><link>/tracknut/about_velodromes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracknut/about_velodromes/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page gives you a detailed tour around velodromes, using the indoor velodromes in Ontario and Quebec as examples:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ontario Track Cycling Resources</title><link>/tracknut/ontario_track_resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracknut/ontario_track_resources/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page contains links to velodromes and organizations of interest to riders in Ontario&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Essential Rules of the Track</title><link>/tracknut/basic_rules/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracknut/basic_rules/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page is deliberately short. We ride the track &lt;em>a lot&lt;/em> and we keep coming across people not following these essential rules, resulting is quite a number of close calls. Crashes in recreational track cycling are rare, and we want to keep them that way!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Physics of Riding on Track Bankings</title><link>/tracknut/track-physics-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tracknut/track-physics-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Three questions frequently crop up around the physics of riding around track bankings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>What kind of G-forces do riders experience when riding though bankings at speed?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A low speeds a rider &amp;ldquo;leans out&amp;rdquo; in the banking as gravity pushes them down the track. A high speeds a rider leans in as the centrifugal force tends to push them up the track. There is a speed when a rider transitions between these two states, a speed when the bike is exactly orthogonal to (i.e. perpendicular to, or at 90 degrees to) the surface of the track. What is this speed?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the minimum speed you need to ride to avoid &amp;ldquo;falling off&amp;rdquo; in a banking?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The material that follows is based on two excellent posts on the subject:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

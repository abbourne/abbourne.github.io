Or sweat it out indoors on a trainer, listening to music or a video to combat the boredom?
There’s another option! With the construction of the Mattamy National Cycling Centre for the Pan Am Games, there’s a beautiful world-class indoor velodrome facility within reasonable driving distance of Ottawa. I expect many people associate “velodrome” with competitive cycling - that it’s just for the racers, cyclo-sportifs, the “really fast guys”.</description></item><item><title>Velodrome Basics</title><link>/pages/tracknut/about_velodromes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/tracknut/about_velodromes/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page gives you a detailed tour around velodromes, using the two indoor velodromes in Ontario as examples:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ontario Track Cycling Resources</title><link>/pages/tracknut/ontario_track_resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/tracknut/ontario_track_resources/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page contains links to velodromes and organizations of interest to riders in Ontario&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Essential Rules of the Track</title><link>/pages/tracknut/basic_rules/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/tracknut/basic_rules/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page is deliberately short.

We&amp;rsquo;re a couple of, well old, guys from Ontario that have re-discovered the joy of track cycling after over 30 years absence from the track. With the construction of the amazing Mattamy National Cycling Centre in 2015, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the lure of a UCI class 1 velodrome on our doorstep. We&amp;rsquo;re generally on the track multiple times a week.</description></item></channel></rss>

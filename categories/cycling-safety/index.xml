&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sealant must be replaced every few months, at least once a season.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sealant does not always seal a hole, especially if the hole is larger than a few mm.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need to carry either a spare tube (and a tool to remove the tubeless value) or tire plugs and a small tube of sealant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Having sealant spewing out can get really messy!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can&amp;rsquo;t go about 75psi with tubeless tires, so tubeless and skinny tires don&amp;rsquo;t work together. Jay Heins of Hene Herse, who makes some of the world&amp;rsquo;s best tubeless tires says don&amp;rsquo;t go about 6-psi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Valve core clogs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tubeless tires are much more diufficult to install and remove. It can be difficult to get the bead to seal on the rim - often rapid inflation with a special &amp;ldquo;charger pump&amp;rdquo; or an air compressor is required.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

But the most important one of all is “where the rubber meets the road”. Tires may be the most important component on your bike. The right tire at the right pressure makes a huge difference to your safety - your “grip” on the road - as well as to your comfort, and efficiency.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“&lt;strong>Given the amount of time I spend on a bike, I recognize there is a significant probability that my cycling career, or even my life, could end as a result of a serious cycling accident&lt;/strong>”.
As a cyclist, the risk of injury requiring hospital treatment (per km travelled) is significantly greater than when in a motor vehicle. The more you cycle, the greater the risk - &lt;strong>You will crash!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

I&amp;rsquo;m a National Coaching Certification Program (NCCP) trained coach and coach youth in the OBC’s Youth Development Program. I’m a Cycling Canada CanBike instructor, and I teach riding skills, traffic safety, and ride leading to adults. I also volunteer, both in Ottawa and at the Mattamy National Cycling Center velodrome in Toronto.</description></item></channel></rss>

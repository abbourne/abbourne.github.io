I became a manager in 1981, although I continued to write production code until 1986. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to keep my hand in, even as I became a senior manager and a director.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a principal founder of a video games start-up, had 2 games on the Billboard top 40, and wrote applications for Apple and Microsoft.</description></item></channel></rss>

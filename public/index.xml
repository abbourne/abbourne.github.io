      <description>Cycling Since my biggest activity is cycling, I&amp;rsquo;m of course, a member of multiple clubs and organizations:
Ottawa Bicycle Club is my &amp;ldquo;home club&amp;rdquo;. One of largest cycling club&amp;rsquo;s in Canada, with over 1,000 members, the OBC offers touring, gravel riding, time trials, and various events like the Rideal Lakes Cycle Tour.</description>

      <description>Life Behind Bars While I&amp;rsquo;ve not given up my love of software technology and development practices completely, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved from coaching software developers to coaching young cyclists. I&amp;rsquo;m a National Coaching Certification Program (NCCP) trained coach and coach youth in the OBC’s Youth Development Program. I’m a Cycling Canada CanBike instructor, and I teach riding skills, traffic safety, and ride leading to adults.</description>

      <description>Why? This site is my place to put various articles and information that I feel like sharing. Sometimes feel compelled to opine on a topic. I don&amp;rsquo;t rally expect people to read my writings, but maybe the odd person will find something useful!
What? When I was working, I had a blog where I wrote technology articles.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m reading Peter Singer&amp;rsquo;s book The Life You can Save (you can freely download the book from the website), in which he makes a profound observation. He challenges the assumption about our behavior that permeates western, and particularly American, culture: &amp;ldquo;the norm of self-interest&amp;rdquo;:
Alexis de Tocqueville, that sharp observer of the American psyche during the formative years of the United States, noticed the norm even then: “Americans,” he wrote in 1835, “enjoy explaining almost every act of their lives on the principle of self-interest.</description>

      <title>Tires - Be Faster, Safer, More Comfortable</title>

      <description>In cycling, “contact points” are critical: bum on saddle, hands on handlebars, feet on pedals. But the most important one of all is “where the rubber meets the road”. Tires may be the most important component on your bike. The right tire at the right pressure makes a huge difference to your safety - your “grip” on the road - as well as to your comfort, and efficiency.</description>

      <description>You will crash - learn to crash properly I’m in the middle of a tight pack of two dozen racers at the Pan-Am Games velodrome, 5 laps from the end of the race, averaging 45kph. There’s a sudden slowing as riders position themselves for the finishing sprint. I hear swearing, and the unmistakable sound of carbon wheels scraping each other as multiple riders make contact at speed.</description>

      <description>In the previous article, we mentioned that many serious cycling injuries happen when cyclists are slowing and preparing to stop. So let’s discuss some techniques to prevent low speed falls.
Now all this may seem like a lot of effort. But it’s much preferable to broken bones! (As the old aged goes… you can say me now or pay me later!</description>

      <description>I’ll be blunt: “Given the amount of time I spend on a bike, I recognize there is a significant probability that my cycling career, or even my life, could end as a result of a serious cycling accident”. As a cyclist, the risk of injury requiring hospital treatment (per km travelled) is significantly greater than when in a motor vehicle.</description>

      <description>BANG! Hisss…! A Puncture! But who? Where? I’m riding in a peloton of 24 tightly packed riders in the middle of the steep banking on the Pan-Am Games Velodrome in Milton Ontario. It’s impossible to stay up on the banking after a puncture. Everyone knows someone is going down, and is going to take other riders with them.</description>

      <description>In the depths of winter, options for cycling become less appealing… Do I ride outdoors in the cold, wet, and wind? Or sweat it out indoors on a trainer, listening to music or a video to combat the boredom?
There’s another option! With the construction of the Mattamy National Cycling Centre for the Pan Am Games, there’s a beautiful world-class indoor velodrome facility within reasonable driving distance of Ottawa.</description>

      <guid>/tracknut/basic_rules/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This page is deliberately short. We ride the track &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; and we keep coming across people not following these essential rules, resulting is quite a number of close calls. Crashes in recreational track cycling are rare, and we want to keep them that way!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Introduction Many Flavours of Markdown There are many variants of Markdown formats, and each processor may support a range of extensions, and interpret the Markdown specifications in somwhat different ways. The main formats include:
Markdown - this is the classic orginal version Multimarkdown - the orginal extension to Markdown GitHub Flavored Markdown -a small set of extension to Markdown defined by GitHub Kramdown - extensive set of extensions based on PHP markdown Extra package and Maruku Pandoc - extensive set of extensions, but strays from the original markdown syntax and extensions somewhat Markdown Processors There are also many different Markdown processors, each with their own quirks.</description>

      <description>Introduction This article focuses on markdown as supported by Hugo and Pandoc. Here are a few good Markdown references and tutorials:
Markdown Guide Wikipedia Markdown entry CommonMark - the markdown &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Markdown Hugo uses the GoldMark as it&amp;rsquo;s default Markdown processor. Goldmark supports the CommonMark standard, along with:
Tables, Strikethrough, Autolinks, TaskLists from GitHub-Flavored Markdown Definition Lists and Footnotes from PHP Markdown Extra Special typographic characters from SmartyPants Embedded HTML may be enabled in the Hugo Site Configuration Attribute lists on headings and block elements to add styling.</description>

      <description>This page tests and documents using MathJax, Latex and AsciiMath with Hugo and markdown.
Getting a Markdown Processor to Ignore Markup MathJax, AsciiMath, and similar processors use special markup characters in the the html file. Often these characters overlap with markdown&amp;rsquo;s markup, and the markdown processor will mess things up. There are a number of options:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many recreational cyclists are using tubeless tires without understanding how to maintain them, or their downsides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sealant must be replaced every few months, at least once a season.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sealant does not always seal a hole, especially if the hole is larger than a few mm.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You need to carry either a spare tube (and a tool to remove the tubeless value) or tire plugs and a small tube of sealant&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Having sealant spewing out can get really messy!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t go about 75psi with tubeless tires, so tubeless and skinny tires don&amp;rsquo;t work together. Jay Heins of Hene Herse, who makes some of the world&amp;rsquo;s best tubeless tires says don&amp;rsquo;t go about 6-psi.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Valve core clogs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tubeless tires are much more diufficult to install and remove. It can be difficult to get the bead to seal on the rim - often rapid inflation with a special &amp;ldquo;charger pump&amp;rdquo; or an air compressor is required.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.renehersecycles.com/the-trouble-with-road-tubeless/&#34;&gt;The trouble with road tubeless&lt;/a&gt; - Rene Herse&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://road.cc/content/feature/9-things-they-dont-tell-you-about-tubeless-tyres-257746&#34;&gt;Nine things they don&amp;rsquo;t tell you about tuneless tires&lt;/a&gt; - road.cc&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The most important contact point on a bike is “where the rubber meets the road”. Tires may be the most important component on your bike. The right tire at the right pressure makes a huge difference to your safety - your “grip” on the road - as well as to your comfort, and efficiency. You can have it all with wider tires.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Given the amount of time I spend on a bike, I recognize there is a significant probability that my cycling career, or even my life, could end as a result of a serious cycling accident&lt;/strong&gt;”.&#xA;As a cyclist, the risk of injury requiring hospital treatment  (per km travelled) is significantly greater than when in a motor vehicle. The more you cycle, the greater the risk - &lt;strong&gt;You will crash!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

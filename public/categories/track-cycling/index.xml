      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the depths of winter, options for cycling become less appealing… Do I ride outdoors in the cold, wet, and wind? Or sweat it out indoors on a trainer, listening to music or a video to combat boredom?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s another option - Indoor velodromes! Living in Ottawa, there are now three excellent velodromes I can frequent:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Essential Rules of the Track</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/tracknut/basic_rules/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This page is deliberately short. We ride the track &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; and we keep coming across people not following these essential rules, resulting is quite a number of close calls. Crashes in recreational track cycling are rare, and we want to keep them that way!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Physics of Riding on Track Bankings</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/tracknut/track-physics-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three questions frequently crop up around the physics of riding around track bankings:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What kind of G-forces do riders experience when riding though bankings at speed?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A low speeds a rider &amp;ldquo;leans out&amp;rdquo; in the banking as gravity pushes them down the track. A high speeds a rider leans in as the centrifugal force tends to push them up the track. There is a speed when a rider transitions between these two states, a speed when the bike is exactly orthogonal to (i.e. perpendicular to, or at 90 degrees to) the surface of the track. What is this speed?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is the minimum speed you need to ride to avoid &amp;ldquo;falling off&amp;rdquo; in a banking?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The material that follows is based on two excellent posts on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

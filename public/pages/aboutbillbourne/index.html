			<p>I started programming in 1972 (Fortran, APL, assembler) Even though my university degree
was in Electrical Engineering, my whole professional career has been software related.
I became a manager in 1981, although I continued to write production code until 1986.
I&rsquo;ve tried to keep my hand in, even as I became a senior manager and a director.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a principal founder of a video games start-up, had 2 games on the Billboard top 40, and
wrote applications for Apple and Microsoft. I&rsquo;ve spent 20 years in the telecommunications industry developing firmware for
phones, embedded software for optical network elements, and network management software.
I&rsquo;ve been an architect, a product manager, and held various management positions over the years, including senior manager and director level positions.</p>
<p>I started Macintosh programming in July 1983 on a prototype 128K Mac with a Lisa &ldquo;twiggy&rdquo; disk drive.
And I still love Macs&hellip; I&rsquo;ve got a BSD-like UNIX, MacOS, and Windows all running on my MacBook Pro. It&rsquo;s the perfect software development machine!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now providing consulting on software development process and practices improvement, from requirements through verification. While much of the work involves Agile projects, I also consult to teams using other methodologies. I can help you with project inception, getting a new team or project running effectively. I also help rescue projects that have gotten into the weeds, or just want to improve some aspect of their development process. Much of my work focuses on the timeless software development practices that transcend particular methodologies: requirements specification &amp; reviews, design reviews, code inspections, continuous integration, static analysis, designer automated testing, including TDD, and verification test automation.</p>

The [Axios](https://www.axios.com/) article "[Behind the Curtain: Media vs. reporting](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/20/government-shutdown-media-vs-reporting-musk?stream=top)" comments on the December 2024 antics of Elon Musk and Donald Trump interfering with the attempts of the US House of Representatives to pass a spending authorization bill.

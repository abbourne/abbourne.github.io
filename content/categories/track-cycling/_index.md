**Note:** This series of articles was written in 2017 on their own website, then abandoned. I've resurrected and updated them here.

Back in 2015, I re-discovered the joy of track cycling after 30 years absence from the track. With the construction of the [Mattamy National Cycling Centre](http://www.mattamynationalcyclingcentre.ca/en/index.asp) in Milton for the Pan-Am games, I couldn't resist the lure of an international class velodrome within driving distance.

I also volunteer, at the track helping to run events. And I coach, supporting [Ottawa Bicycle Club](https://www.ottawabicycleclub.ca/) Youth and Racing program athletes at the [Mattamy National Cycling Centre](http://www.mattamynationalcyclingcentre.ca/en/index.asp), or at one of our two other velodromes in the region - [Centre National de Cyclisme de Bromont](https://centrenationalbromont.com/velodrome-multisports/) south of Montreal and the [Forest City Velodrome](https://www.forestcityvelodrome.ca/) in London Ontario.

I'm passionate about track, and have introduced over 150 people from age 9 to senior citizens to the fun of riding steeply banked velodromes.

Post retirement I've found myself drawn into cycling coaching. I coach youth in the [OBC's Youth Development Program](https://www.ottawabicycleclub.ca/index.php/youth-program). I'm a [Cycling Canada CanBike](http://canbikecanada.ca/) instructor, and I teach riding skills, traffic safety, and ride leading to adults.

It's true that the best way to learn something well is to teach it to someone else. It forces you to reflect deeply on what you think you know. This is especially true of coaching. By approaching coaching with humility and a passion for the subject, I find I'm always learning and growing.

To quote from an article in this series:

 > **“Given the amount of time I spend on a bike, I recognize there is a significant probability that my cycling career, or even my life, could end as a result of a serious cycling accident”. As a cyclist, the risk of injury requiring hospital treatment (per km travelled) is significantly greater than when in a motor vehicle. The more you cycle, the greater the risk.**

 So maybe it's not surprising that my biggest area of growth in the last five years has been in riding skills and traffic safety. I've learned so much through coaching and listening to experts. I now ride very differently now than I did a few years ago.

I help out with the Safety and Education program at the [Kanata Nepean Bicycle Club](https://knbc.ca/). As part of that work, I started a
"Safety and Education blog on the KNBC Members website. But I realized that many of the articles would be useful to a wider audience, so I've started posting them here.

## Keep in Mind

Everyone has their own perspectives and biases, so before you dive into this series, you should be aware of mine:

1. **"Maximize the challenge while minimizing the risk"** - Everyone has their own perceptions of risk and "draw the line" in different places. I try to find all reasonable ways to minimize risk, while still participating to the fullest in my sport. For example, I like to descend fast... I'm thrilled if I can hit 80KPH on a descent. But I wear a helmet, make careful mechanical checks of my bike before every ride, carefully check my tires and replace them regularly, and will slow down if I don't know the descent well, or can't see around a turn. I have no problem riding on busy road in traffic, but I don't find that fun, and I don't commute anymore, so I try to avoid heavy traffic.
2. **Not trying to win a World Tour Race** - I don't pour over Formula 1 technology to decide what car to buy. And while what's used in the pro peloton is interesting it has only peripheral applicability to much of the riding recreational and sportif cyclists do. Many of the finer points of cycling technology make such a small difference that we will never notice them on our rides (Really... you just *think* you notice! [The Placebo Effect and Marginal Gains](https://marginalgainspodcast.cc/the-placebo-effect-and-marginal-gains/) ) I'm concerned about what *really* can make a difference to me.
3. **Considered Opinion** - I try to be as fact-based as I can. I research a topic pretty thoroughly, and double-check information. I use reputable, credible references. I'll provide links to references to back up a post. But I'm not attempting to write a definitive  scholarly article.

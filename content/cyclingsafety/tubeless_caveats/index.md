Many recreational cyclists are using tubeless tires without understanding how to maintain them, or their downsides.

- Sealant must be replaced every few months, at least once a season.
- Sealant does not always seal a hole, especially if the hole is larger than a few mm.
- You need to carry either a spare tube (and a tool to remove the tubeless value) or tire plugs and a small tube of sealant
- Having sealant spewing out can get really messy!
- You can't go about 75psi with tubeless tires, so tubeless and skinny tires don't work together. Jay Heins of Hene Herse, who makes some of the world's best tubeless tires says don't go about 6-psi.
- Valve core clogs
- Tubeless tires are much more diufficult to install and remove. It can be difficult to get the bead to seal on the rim - often rapid inflation with a special "charger pump" or an air compressor is required.

There are several disadvantages of using tubeless tires on road bikes:

Cost: Tubeless tires can be more expensive than traditional clincher tires, and may require special rims and valves.

Difficulty of installation: Installing tubeless tires can be more difficult than traditional clincher tires, especially for those who are not familiar with the process. The tires need to be seated properly, and air pressure needs to be carefully monitored during installation.

Sealant maintenance: Tubeless tires require sealant to be added to the tire to seal any punctures. This sealant needs to be checked and replenished regularly, which can be time-consuming.

Limited availability: Not all tire brands and models are available in tubeless versions, which can limit the options for riders.

Compatibility issues: Tubeless tires may not be compatible with some rims or frames, which can limit their usefulness for some riders.

Need for special tools: Tubeless tires may require special tools, such as tire levers and sealant injectors, which can be an additional expense.

Increased weight: Tubeless tires and rims can be heavier than traditional clincher tires and rims, which can affect the overall weight and performance of the bike.

Limited repair options: In the event of a puncture or other damage, repairing a tubeless tire can be more difficult than repairing a traditional clincher tire. In some cases, the tire may need to be replaced entirely.

Air loss: Tubeless tires can lose air more quickly than traditional clincher tires, which can require more frequent inflation.

Overall, while tubeless tires offer certain advantages, such as reduced risk of pinch flats and improved traction, there are also several disadvantages that riders should consider before making the switch.

There are several disadvantages of using tubeless tires on road bikes:

Limited tire selection: Currently, there are fewer options available for tubeless tires as compared to traditional clincher tires.

Difficulty in installation: Tubeless tires are difficult to install and require specialized tools and expertise.

Higher cost: Tubeless tires are generally more expensive than traditional clincher tires.

Sealant leakage: The sealant used to seal the tubeless system can sometimes leak out, causing a mess and requiring reapplication.

Burping: During hard cornering or under high pressure, the tire can "burp" and lose air, causing a sudden loss of control.

Rim compatibility: Not all rims are compatible with tubeless tires, so upgrading to a tubeless system may require purchasing new wheels.

Maintenance: Tubeless systems require more maintenance than traditional clincher tires, including regular checking of sealant levels and replacing damaged sealant.

Weight: Tubeless systems are generally heavier than traditional clincher tires, which may affect performance and speed.

Reduced aerodynamics: The additional material required for tubeless systems can reduce the aerodynamics of the tire, which may be a concern for competitive cyclists.

Complexity: Tubeless systems are more complex than traditional clincher tires, which can be intimidating for some riders and require additional knowledge to properly maintain and repair.

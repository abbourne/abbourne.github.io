## Cycling

Since my biggest activity is cycling, I'm of course, a member of multiple clubs and organizations:

* [Ottawa Bicycle Club](https://www.ottawabicycleclub.ca/) is my "home club". One of largest cycling club's in Canada, with over 1,000 members, the OBC offers touring, gravel riding, time trials, and various events like the [Rideal Lakes Cycle Tour](https://www.ottawabicycleclub.ca/rlct/).
* [Kanata Nepean Bicyclke Club](https://knbc.ca/)
* [Cross-Canada Cycle Touring Society](https://cccts.org/)
* [Ottawa Rambling Club](https://ottawaramblingclub.org/)

## Other Connections

I do a bit of photography, mostly travel and cycling events. You can see my portfolio and albums at [Bill Bourne Photography](https://billbourne.myportfolio.com/photography)

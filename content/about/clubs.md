## Cycling Clubs

Since my biggest activity is cycling, I'm of course, a member of multiple clubs and organizations:

[<img src="../images/OBC-400x229.png" alt="Ottawa Bicycle Club" width="125px" class="left">](https://www.ottawabicycleclub.ca/) The [OBC](https://www.ottawabicycleclub.ca/) is my "home club". One of largest cycling club's in Canada, with over 1,000 members, the OBC offers touring, gravel riding, time trials, and various events like the [Rideau Lakes Cycle Tour](https://www.ottawabicycleclub.ca/rlct/).
<br/><br/>

[<img src="../images/knbc.jpg" alt="Kanata Nepean Bicycle Club" width="125px" class="left">](https://knbc.ca/) The [Kanata Nepean Bicycle Club](https://knbc.ca/) is a purely recreational touring club - I do most of my touring rides with the KNBC.
<br/><br/>

[<img src="../images/CCCTS.jpg" alt="Cross Canada Cycle Touring Society" width="125px" class="left">](https://cccts.org/) The [Cross Canada Cycle Touring Society](https://cccts.org//) is another purely recreational touring club - They have chapters in British Columbia as well as Ottawa. They organize a lot of away tours, including many outside of North America. My wife and I do most of our multi-day "away" cycle touring with the CCCTS.
<br/><br/>

## Other Activities

I do a bit of photography, mostly travel and cycling events. You can see my portfolio and albums at [Bill Bourne Photography](https://billbourne.myportfolio.com/photography)

I volunteer in the [OCISO Career Mentoring Program](https://ociso.org/career-mentorship/), mentoring international professionals who are new immigrants to Canada.

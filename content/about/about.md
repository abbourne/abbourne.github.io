## Why?

This site is my place to put various articles and information that I feel like sharing. Sometimes feel compelled to
 opine on a topic. I don't rally expect people to read my writings, but maybe the odd person will find something useful!

## What?

When I was working, I had a blog where I wrote technology articles. This website is focussed on cycling articles, since that's my current passion. 

## How? (About the Technology)

This site is generated with the static site generator (SSG) [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This allows me to:

* Write my content using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Markdown is a simple plain text document format that can be easily and quickly processed to generate html, pdf, .docx, and a number of other file formats. I use it for just about all my writing - for documents and articles (I avoid Microsoft Word) at all costs!), note taking, and for writing web pages.
* Quickly generate an efficient, fast website. Since the website is made up only of static webpages and a little JavaScript, it's fast.
* Host for free on great cloud infrastructure. There are a number of companies that off robust, fast web hosting of static websites for free. I use [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Both support Hugo (as well as several other SSGs).
* _Relatively_ easy styling and customization using templates. 

## "It's All Downhill From Here"??

As an active senior citizen cyclist who like to ride fast, especially on velodromes, the double-entendre of the phrase is particularly appropriate.

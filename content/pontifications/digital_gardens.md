summary: "A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes." #If exists, is used as the summary text in lists.

The creative trailblazers in cyberspace these days are extolling the virtues of "Digital Gardens". 
Digital Gardens are having a moment - blogs are so 20th century and linear. The standard personal website is too static. 
They are a new approach to the way we publish personal knowledge on the web. Knowing nothing about them, and struggling with my own online presence,
I figured I'd better educate myself. This note is a summary of my limited research learning about what digital gardens are, there characteristics,
and why they might be a good alternative to traditional personal blogs.

## What is a Digital Garden?

Think of a digital garden as an online notebook and personal wiki space. 
It contains an evolving, cross-linked collection of evolving ideas. Published notes grow and morph over time.

They channel the ethos of the early days of the web - an open, participatory, uncontrolled, grassroots, bottom up, hyperlinked sea of ideas.
A time when people had few notions of how websites "should be".

A digital garden is similar to the idea of a [Second Brain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-second-brain-why-you-need-one-glen-long/),
a tern coined by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com/). Although a Second Brain tends to be a private collection of notes, usually arranged in small snippets,
while the Digital Garden is a public offering of a wide range of content.

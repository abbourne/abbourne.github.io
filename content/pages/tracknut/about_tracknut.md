Welcome to Track Nut! 
We're a couple of, well *old*, guys from Ontario that have re-discovered the joy of track cycling after over 30 years absence from the track. With the construction of the amazing [Mattamy National Cycling Centre](http://www.mattamynationalcyclingcentre.ca/en/index.asp) in 2015, we couldn't resist the lure of a [UCI class 1 velodrome](http://www.uci.ch/track/news/article/what-you-should-know-about-velodromes/) on our doorstep. We're generally on the track multiple times a week.
